0 <= time <=  1440 (1 day = 1440 minutes)
distance = time
taxi = max 4 customers

look for customers starting at the same node and have same destination? 
 => don't exist so no use to do this!

sort customers, don't take randomly
 => type of sort?
    1: close to start, early pickup
    2: far from start, early pickup
    3: close to start, late pickup
    4: far from start, late pickup
    implemented: early pickup as minimum in sort
